## Overview
This is a work in progress. This repository is a [Copier template](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) for setting up charms with the
pytest-operator testing framework. When complete, the intention is to take a standar charm template, or existing reactive charm and add the
necessary boilerplate to have unit and integration tests as well as some standard settings for lint.
